# SURFS_UP

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to combine our knowledge of pandas with the newer function of flask, being able to apply what we have learned and made a very simple web page, in which anyone with the correct url would be able to interact with. This is moving us from more theoretically usage of the coding we have learned into more applicable knowledge, closer to a real world situation. 

# Results

After completing the 2 deliverables, there were several key differences between weather in June and December, which could be useful for anyone who works in a field related to weather. One very important distinction is the fact that June on average is roughly 4 degrees Farenheit warmer than the counterpart day in December. Surpisingly, however, December's weather was relatively warm, with a peak day of 83 degrees, only 2 degrees lower than June's peak day. However, the low is a lot more spread out, with December having days all the way down to 56 degrees Farenheit, not ideal weather for outdoors.

# Summary

One additional query could be to create graphs, either a bar or line chart, for each month, and to place them side by side for an easy visual comparison, as just looking purely at the list of numbers or summary statistics isn's as intuitive. Another query that could aid in the analysis of weather would be placing the temperatures of every single month in their own dataframe, getting the summary statistics, and then using flask, create routes for every month, so anybody would be able to confirm the relative temperatures to be expected for those months.
